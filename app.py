    This dashboard provides oversight required by quality management systems to ensure projects are controlled, risks are managed, and progress is visible to leadership.

    - **Project & Timeline Management**: Supports the overall management of **Design Controls** as required by:
        - **21 CFR 820.30(b)**: *Design and Development Planning* - Establishes a framework for plans that identify, describe, and assign activities.
        - **ISO 13485:2016, Section 7.3.2**: *Design and Development Planning* - The organization shall plan and control the design and development of product.

    - **Risk Matrix**: Directly supports the implementation of a **Risk Management** process throughout the product lifecycle as mandated by:
        - **ISO 14971:2019**: *Medical devices ‚Äî Application of risk management*. The visualization helps in identifying and prioritizing risks for control measures.
        - **21 CFR 820.30(g)**: *Design Risk Analysis* - Requires the identification and evaluation of risks, and ensuring they are mitigated.
        
    - **Advanced Process Analytics (See ML-Driven Page)**: This dashboard includes an additional page with Machine Learning models. These serve as **investigational and process improvement tools**, aligning with the principles of **ICH Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System)**, which encourages a scientific, risk-based approach to continual improvement throughout the product lifecycle. These models supplement, but do not replace, the validated methods required by 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485.
