        #### Purpose
        This Gantt chart provides a dynamic, forward-looking view of instrument utilization. It replaces a static list with an interactive schedule, allowing for efficient resource planning and identification of potential bottlenecks.
        #### Analysis
        The timeline clearly shows that **PCR-01** is currently blocked for overdue preventative maintenance, and **PCR-02** is non-operational (OOS). This indicates an immediate risk to any PCR-based workflow. Conversely, HPLC-02 is available today but scheduled for use tomorrow, allowing for proactive planning of other experiments.

        A heatmap provides an instant visual summary of the lab's skill matrix. It is far more effective than a table of checkmarks for identifying gaps and single points of failure.
        #### Analysis
        The heatmap immediately reveals that **Peter Jones** is a potential risk, as he is not trained on any of the advanced assays (PCR or NGS). It also shows that **John Doe** is the only analyst currently in training for the critical NGS Lib Prep method, highlighting a potential future bottleneck if Jane Smith or Susan Chen are unavailable.

        This bar chart aggregates the heatmap data into a high-level management metric. It answers the question: "For any given assay, what percentage of our team is fully certified to run it?"

        While readiness for HPLC and Safety is 100% of the core team, the readiness for **NGS Lib Prep** is only 50%. This is a significant risk. If the two certified analysts are unavailable, the entire NGS workflow stops. This data justifies the need for cross-training Peter Jones and completing John Doe's training as a high priority.
