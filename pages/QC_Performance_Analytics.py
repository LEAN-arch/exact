    #### The Experiment
    To monitor the ongoing performance and stability of a validated assay, a stable Quality Control (QC) material is tested with every batch of production samples. The results of the QC material are plotted over time to detect any shifts, trends, or increased variability in the process.

    #### The Method: Levey-Jennings Chart & Westgard Rules
    - **Levey-Jennings Chart**: A graphical chart used to plot QC data over time. It displays the mean and control limits (typically at ¬±1, ¬±2, and ¬±3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean) derived from historical data.
    - **Westgard Rules**: A set of multi-rule QC procedures used to evaluate whether an analytical run is in-control or out-of-control. By combining several rules, this method improves the detection of both random and systematic errors while reducing false rejection rates. Common rules include:
        - **1_3s**: One point exceeds the ¬±3 SD limit. Detects large random errors.
        - **2_2s**: Two consecutive points exceed the same ¬±2 SD limit. Detects systematic error (bias).
        - **4_1s**: Four consecutive points exceed the same ¬±1 SD limit. Detects small, sustained systematic error.

        - The **4_1s violation** ending at Run 23 indicates a sustained, small systematic bias in the process.

    #### The Experiment
    To ensure the consistency of manufacturing, each new lot of a critical reagent must be tested and compared against the current, in-use lot. This is a crucial part of the **Incoming Acceptance** process. Data is collected from multiple runs of both the new and reference lots.

    #### The Method: ANOVA
    - **Box Plots**: Used to visually compare the distribution (median, spread, and range) of results from each reagent lot.
    - **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: A powerful statistical test used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent groups. The test calculates a **P-value**, which is the probability of observing the data if there were truly no difference between the lots.
