    - **Lot Acceptance (21 CFR 820.80)**: The lot-to-lot comparison provides objective evidence to accept or reject incoming lots of critical reagents, a key component of our device acceptance activities.
    - **CAPA (21 CFR 820.100)**: Out-of-control events detected by SPC charts or failing lot qualifications are primary inputs into the Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) system for investigation.

    #### The Method: Levey-Jennings Chart with Westgard Rules
    A **Levey-Jennings Chart** is a specialized control chart used to plot Quality Control (QC) data over time. For our RT-PCR assays, we plot the **Cycle threshold (Ct) value** of a consistent positive control material. The chart displays the mean and control limits (typically at ¬±1, ¬±2, and ¬±3 standard deviations) derived from historical data.

    **Westgard Rules** are a set of multi-rule QC procedures that provide objective criteria to determine if an analytical run is in-control or out-of-control. This improves error detection while reducing false alarms.

    **Crucial Interpretation for Ct Values:** Remember that for Ct values, a **lower number is better** (indicating more efficient amplification), and a **higher number is worse**. Therefore, a downward shift is a positive process change (improvement), while an upward shift is a negative process change (degradation).

        **Interpretation of Violations:**
        - **10_x Rule Violation (Runs 15-24)**: Ten consecutive points are on the same side of the mean (in this case, below it). This signals a **sustained systematic shift** in the process, indicating it is now running more efficiently. While this may seem positive, any un-investigated shift is a risk.
        - **1_3s Rule Violation (Run 25)**: One point has exceeded the +3 SD limit (a higher Ct value). This is a critical **run rejection** rule, indicating a significant, negative deviation, possibly due to a large random error (e.g., pipetting error, inhibitor).

        **Action Required:** The `1_3s` violation requires immediate rejection of the run and associated patient samples. The `10_x` trend, although seemingly an "improvement," requires a formal investigation to determine the root cause of the shift (e.g., a new reagent lot, a change in instrument performance). The process mean and limits may need to be recalculated after the cause is identified and controlled.

    #### The Experiment
    To ensure the consistency of our NGS assays, each new lot of a critical reagent (like a library preparation kit) must be formally qualified against the current in-use lot. A standard DNA control is run through the library preparation process using both the new and reference lots, and a key performance metric (e.g., **Final Library Yield**) is compared.

    #### The Method: ANOVA
    - **Box Plots**: Used to visually compare the distribution (median, spread, and outliers) of library yields from each reagent lot.
    - **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: A statistical test used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more groups. The test calculates a **P-value**, which is the probability of observing the data if there were truly no difference between the lots. A low P-value suggests a real difference exists.
