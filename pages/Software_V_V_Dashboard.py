        A **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a document that traces the lineage of each requirement throughout the development lifecycle. It provides a many-to-many relationship mapping between user needs, functional specifications, design documents, and the test cases that verify them.
        
        #### The Metrics
        - **Test Status**: The current outcome of the associated test case. 'Pass' indicates the requirement has been successfully verified. 'Fail' indicates a defect was found. 'In Progress' means testing has not been completed.
        - **Requirements Coverage (KPI)**: A direct measure of traceability. A 100% coverage rate is a prerequisite for software release, ensuring no requirement has been overlooked.

        This matrix provides an auditable, at-a-glance view of validation readiness. In this example, we can see that user need **URS-03** has a failing test case, which is a blocker for release. Furthermore, user need **URS-04** is still in progress. These two items represent the critical path to completing the software validation.

        #### The Metrics
        - **Total Defects Opened (Red Line)**: Represents the total number of bugs found to date. A steep, continuous rise can indicate systemic quality issues.

        #### The Method
        A **Pareto Chart** is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph. It is based on the **Pareto Principle (or 80/20 rule)**, which states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In software, this means a small number of modules or categories often contain the majority of the defects.
        
        #### The Metrics
        - **Defect Count (Bars)**: The absolute number of defects found in each category, sorted from highest to lowest.
        - **Cumulative Percentage (Red Line)**: The cumulative sum of the percentage of total defects for each category.
        
        #### Analysis of Results
        This chart is a powerful tool for prioritizing quality improvement efforts. The analysis clearly shows that the **UI/UX** and **Calculation Engine** categories account for the vast majority of all defects (approximately 70%, based on the cumulative line). This is a strong, data-driven insight. Instead of spreading testing resources thinly across all modules, the team should focus their efforts‚Äîsuch as code reviews, adding more unit tests, or targeted exploratory testing‚Äîon these two "vital few" areas to achieve the greatest impact on overall software quality.
